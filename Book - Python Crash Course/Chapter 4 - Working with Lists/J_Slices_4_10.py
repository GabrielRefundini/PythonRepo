# Print the message The first three items in the list are:. Then use a slice to print the first three items from that programâ€™s list.
print(f"The first three items in the list are: {multiples [:3]}")
# Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are:. Then use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.
print(f" Three items from the middle of the list are: {multiples[4:7]}")
# Print the message The last three items in the list are:. Then use a slice to print the last three items in the list.
print(f"The last three items in the list are: {multiples[-3:]}")
