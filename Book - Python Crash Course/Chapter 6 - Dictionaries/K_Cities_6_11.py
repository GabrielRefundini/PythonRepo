# Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. 
# Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is in, 
# its approximate population, and one fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like country,
# population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the information you have stored about it.
